# OperatingSystemsPresentation

This is an interactive webpage designed for a presentation on the topic of deadlocks in operating systems. The project explains the core concepts of deadlocks and features a live simulation to demonstrate a circular wait condition.

## Features

* **Multi-Section Layout:** The page is divided into distinct, themed sections for each topic.
* **Smooth Scrolling:** A custom JavaScript implementation provides a fluid, inertia-based scrolling effect.
* **Blended Transitions:** Modern CSS is used to create curved, "scooped" transitions that blend the colors between each section.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
* **Interactive Simulation:** An HTML5 Canvas element with JavaScript logic provides a live, animated demonstration of a deadlock scenario.
* **Reactive Footer:** A clean, modern footer lists the project contributors with a hover effect.
